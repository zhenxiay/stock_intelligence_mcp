# Technical Indicator: Relative Strength Index (RSI)

## Introduction
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and magnitude of recent price changes. Developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in 1978, the RSI is one of the most popular indicators used by traders to identify potential overbought and oversold conditions in an asset.

## What is RSI?
The RSI is plotted as a single line on a separate window below the price chart and oscillates between zero (0) and one hundred (100).

- **Momentum Indicator:** It measures the velocity of price movements.
- **Range:** It is bound between 0 and 100.
- **Default Period:** The standard calculation uses a 14-period lookback (e.g., 14 days on a daily chart, 14 hours on an hourly chart).

## Key Interpretation Zones

The primary use of the RSI is to identify potential overbought and oversold market conditions.

| RSI Range | Interpretation | Trading Implication (Traditional) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Above 70** | **Overbought** | Suggests the asset's price has risen too strongly/quickly and may be due for a downward correction or reversal. |
| **Below 30** | **Oversold** | Suggests the asset's price has fallen too strongly/quickly and may be due for an upward correction or reversal. |
| **50 Centerline** | **Trend Confirmation** | Crossing above 50 often signals a bullish trend; crossing below 50 signals a bearish trend. |

**Note on Trending Markets:** During strong trends, the RSI can remain in overbought territory (above 70) for extended periods in an uptrend, or oversold territory (below 30) in a downtrend. In such cases, these levels may indicate strong momentum rather than an imminent reversal.

## RSI Divergence

A powerful signal generated by the RSI is divergence, which occurs when the price action and the RSI indicator move in opposite directions. This can signal a potential trend reversal.

1.  **Bearish Divergence:**
    * Price makes a **Higher High**.
    * RSI makes a **Lower High**.
    * *Interpretation:* Momentum is weakening despite the price hitting a new high, suggesting a possible bearish reversal.

2.  **Bullish Divergence:**
    * Price makes a **Lower Low**.
    * RSI makes a **Higher Low**.
    * *Interpretation:* Momentum is strengthening despite the price hitting a new low, suggesting a possible bullish reversal.

## How is RSI Calculated?

The RSI is calculated in two parts:

1.  **Relative Strength (RS):**
    $$ RS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}} $$
    * The "Average Gain" is the average of upward price changes over the specified period ($n$).
    * The "Average Loss" is the average of downward price changes (expressed as a positive value) over the specified period ($n$).

2.  **RSI Formula:**
    $$ RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right) $$

The final result normalizes the RS value onto the 0 to 100 scale.
